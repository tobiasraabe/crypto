This is the documentation on the **Cryptocurrency Market Prediction** project.

The project is about price predictions in cryptocurrency markets.


.. _overview:

Overview
========

Currently, this project is more a framework than a fully working prediction
suite. The main parts are a working data collection from different sources and
a framework for prediction models which is similar to scikit-learn's structure.

Additionally, we implemented a moving averages prediction model for which the
results can be viewed in the ``paper``.

You can check how the current implementation works by reading the further
section of the docs.

Future implementations should also comprise LSTMs and support from Twitter
sentiment analysis.
