# This is the config file for the moving averages crossover strategy.

# First, wrap your strategy by an identifier of the pair names. This key will
# be used to find the appropriate processed data (e.g.
# ``<key>_chart_data.p.lzma``).

# After that, define each strategy with an array containing two values where
# the first value indicates the windows size of faster moving average and the
# second value represents the slower moving average.

# Note that, the chart data contains five-minute intervals. If you want to
# determine a 20-day window you have to insert 5760 (12*24*20).
